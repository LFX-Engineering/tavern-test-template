  # TODO: query the Health and Status Endpoint for LFX Security
  # 1. Make a GET request, API endpoint: https://api-gw.dev.platform.linuxfoundation.org/security-service/v2/health
  # 2. Check the response code
  # 3. Confirm the response content-type is application/json
  # 4. Evaluate the response payload, write test logic to ensure the response is considered healthy (look at API response model/example to determine what would be considered good/valid)
  # 5. Run the test to ensure it works
